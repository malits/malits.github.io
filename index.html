      <section>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Max, currently a third-year undergraduate student and researcher at UC Berkeley. At the moment, my interests concern 
          Natural Language Processing and Optimization, two fields which I have the great fortune of working in under Professor Zachary
          Pardos and Professor Miki Lustig. I am also interested in the ethics of Artificial Intelligence, specifically 
          the increased scrutiny and regulation of reinforcement learning algorithms that interact with human beings. 

          Currently, I am investigating the use of large language models like BERT to analyze student short-answer responses, and 
          developing Python wrappers for high-performance iterative optimization algorithms written in C. 

          My other hobbies include running, reading, taking too many math classes for my own good, and organizing concerts. 
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Research Experience</h2>

        <h3>CAHL Lab</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Currently exploring representation learning in the context of citation networks: using the structure of
            a citation network and the rich textual information of its documents to develop distributed representations
            of academics and research faculty. (Manuscript under review)
          </li>
          <li>
            Using said representations to deploy an enhanced student-facing tool for discovering research faculty based
            on a student's academic interests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advisor: Professor Zachary Pardos, PhD
          </li>

        <h3>Berkeley MikGroup</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Working on the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART), an open-source toolkit for computational MRI reconstruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Currently working on developing a Python interface to work directly with C-based reconstruction algorithms and operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed a suite of tutorials to showcase image and array manipulation, Python and MATLAB interpolation
            and basic reconstruction pre-processing tools with BART tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Presented demos at a webinar given to 250+ professionals in the field. Recording available <a href='https://github.com/mrirecon/bart-webinars'>here</a>!

        <h2>Development Experience</h2>

        <h3>Software Developer, AskOski</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked as a full-stack developer on <a href="askoski.berkeley.edu">AskOski</a>, a course search and recommendation system rolling out to 
            more than 40k students across the UC Berkeley campus and other higher education institutions in the Bay Area. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhanced the existing course-search framework by adding a tool that allows students to search
            faculty by research interests, in conjunction with their courses. Expanded the system coverage
            to include not just courses but research opportunities as well. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Extensive work in Python (numpy, pandas, gensim, flask, scikit-learn) and Angular. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Science Intern, Talla</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consolidated and refactored common text pre-processing steps (text normalization, 
            stopword removal, tokenization) throughout a large codebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated a model to identify procedural content into the NLP pipeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trained a classifier and introduced a series of data-driven heuristics to drastically reduce 
            noise and boost precision throughout the process of Named Entity Recognition.
          </li>
        </ul>
